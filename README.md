# tappedtable
A tool to take a tappedout.net url and convert the deck into an image for Tabletop Simulator
The idea behind this was to make it easier to play MTG on Table top simulator which is a fantastic program.

This program will take in a tappedout.net url and after some thinking it outputs a image that can be imported into tabletop simulator.


# How to Use
To run the program you'll need to install the dependencies by running "setup.py install"

After the dependencies have been installed you can run the main file which only asks for a link.

The file is output in the local directory in a new folder with the same name as the deck.

# Future Goals

In the future I would like to add support for flip cards and commander decks. At the moment this has only been tested with casual/standard decks.
